## Files Overview:

### 1. **Theory_Questions.md**
   - **Description**: A Markdown file containing answers to all theoretical questions related to JavaScript concepts. The file covers various topics such as closures, scope, hoisting, and more.
   - **Usage**: This file serves as a reference for understanding core JavaScript concepts and will help solidify your theoretical knowledge.

### 2. **Output_Questions.md**
   - **Description**: A Markdown file with output-based questions. Each question is followed by the expected output and an explanation of why the output occurs in that way.
   - **Usage**: This file is ideal for testing your knowledge and understanding of how JavaScript works, especially in scenarios involving asynchronous code, closures, etc.

### 3. **Movie_Array_Tasks.js**
   - **Description**: A JavaScript file with tasks that involve working with an array of movie objects, similar to examples in the movie array task. It contains exercises that help you practice working with arrays of objects, object properties, and array methods.
   - **Usage**: You can run the file in any JavaScript environment (e.g., browser console, Node.js) to execute the code and verify the functionality of various tasks related to movie arrays.

### 4. **Polyfill.js**
   - **Description**: This file contains implementations for polyfills of `reduce` and `filter` array methods. The purpose of this file is to demonstrate how you can implement basic array methods if they are not natively available.
   - **Usage**: You can run the code in a JavaScript environment to understand how polyfills for these methods work and test them with different use cases.

### 5. **Constructor_Function.js**
   - **Description**: A JavaScript file that defines a `Person` constructor function with a `greet` method added to its prototype. This demonstrates the creation of objects using a constructor function and extending the prototype for additional functionality.
   - **Usage**: Execute the file in a JavaScript environment to create `Person` objects and test the greeting functionality.

### 6. **Interval_Printer.js**
   - **Description**: A JavaScript file that prints numbers from 1 to 10, each number after a 1-second delay. This is achieved using the `setTimeout` function with a delay.
   - **Usage**: Run this file in a browser console or a Node.js environment to see how JavaScript handles timing functions like `setTimeout` and outputs numbers with a delay.
